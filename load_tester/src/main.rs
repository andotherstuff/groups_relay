// It serves as a skeleton for implementing a load testing tool against the Groups Relay.
// The goal is to simulate multiple WebSocket clients, generate test events, collect metrics,
// and provide reporting. This template includes minimal code and detailed comments to guide further implementation.

/// This function is intended to be customized to emulate realistic client behavior.
/// Here are some guidelines for its implementation:
///
/// 1. Establishing the Connection:
///    - Use an asynchronous WebSocket client library, such as tokio-tungstenite,
///      to connect to the given WebSocket URL.
///    - Implement connection retries with exponential backoff in case of failures.
///
/// 2. Sending Test Events:
///    - Decide on a strategy for generating and sending messages. You may want to randomize the content
///      or use predetermined payloads.
///    - Regulate the sending frequency to simulate traffic realistically.
///
/// 3. Receiving Responses:
///    - Listen for responses from the relay to measure latency and success rates.
///    - Update shared metrics or local state as appropriate (e.g., message counts, error rates).
///
/// 4. Error Handling and Cleanup:
///    - Ensure that any errors during connection or messaging are logged and handled gracefully.
///    - Provide a mechanism for clean shutdown so that resources are correctly released.
///
/// Current implementation does nothing substantial, leaving full implementation freedom.
async fn run_client(url: String) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation freedom: Insert your WebSocket connection and handling logic here.
    //
    // For example:
    // let (ws_stream, _) = tokio_tungstenite::connect_async(&url).await?;
    // let (mut sender, mut receiver) = ws_stream.split();
    //
    // Loop to send messages:
    // loop {
    //     sender.send(Message::Text("test message".into())).await?;
    //     // Optionally, wait for a response and measure round-trip latency.
    // }
    //
    // Ensure proper error handling (e.g., connection drops) and cleanup before returning.
